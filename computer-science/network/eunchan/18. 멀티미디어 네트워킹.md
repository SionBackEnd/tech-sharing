1. multimedia : audio
  - analog audio signal sampled at constant rate
    - telephone: 8,000 samples/sec
    - CD music: 44,100 samples/sec
  - each sample quantized, rounded
    - e.g., 2^8=256 possible quantized values
    - each quantized value represented by bits, eg. 8bit for 256 values

<br />

2. multimedia : video
  - video : sequnce of images displayed at constant rate
    - e.g. 24 images/sec
  - digital image : array of pixels
    - each pixel represented by bits
  - coding : use redundancy within and between images to decrase # bits used to encode image
    - spatial (within image)
    - temporal (from one image to next)
  - client-side buffering, playout
    - (1) initial fill of buffer until playout begins at t
    - (2) playout begins at t
    - (3) buffer fill level varies over time as fill rate x(t) varies and playout reate r is constant

<br />

3. streaming multimedia : UDP
  - server sends at rate appropriate for client
    - often : send rate = encoding rate = constant rate
    - transmission rate can be oblivious to congestion levels
  - short playout delay (2-5 seconds) to remove network jitter
  - error recovery : application-level, timeipermitting
  - RTP : multimedia payload types
  - UDP may not go through firewalls

<br />

4. streaming multimedia : HTTP
  - multimedia file retrieved via HTTP GET
  - send ad maximum possible rate under TCP
  - fill rate fluctuates due to TCP congestion control, retransmission
  - larger playout delay: smooth TCP delivery rate
  - HTTP/TCP asses more easily thorugh firewalls

<br />

5. streaming multimedia : DASH
  - DASH : Dynamic, Adaptive streaming over HTTP
  - server
    - devides video file into multiple chunks
    - each chunk stored, encoded at different rates
    - manifest file : provides URLs for different chunks
  - client
    - periodically measures server-to-client bandwidth
    - consulting manifest, requests ine chunk at a time
      - chooses maximum coding rate sustaninable given current bandwith
      - can choose different coding rates at different points in time

<br />

6. Case study: Netflix
  - 30% downstream US traffic in 2011
  - own very little infrastructure, uses 3rd party serivces
    - own registration, payment servers
    - Amazon cloud services :
      - Netflix uploads studio master to Amazon cloud
      - create multiple version of movie (different encodings) in cloud
      - upload versions from cloud to CDNs
      - Cloud hosts Netflix web pages for user browsing
    - three 3rd party CDNs host/stream Netflix content: Akamai, Limelight, Level-3
