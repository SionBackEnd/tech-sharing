1. What is netowrk security?
  - confidentiality: only sender, intended receiver should understand message content
    - sender encrypts message
    - receiver decrypts message
  - authentication: sender, receiver want to confirm identity of each other
  - message integrity: sender, receiver want to ensure message not altered (in transit, or afterwards) without detection
  - access and avaulability: services must be accessible and available to users
  
<br />

2. Friends and enemies: Alice, Bob, Trudy
  - wellknown in network security world
  - Bob, Alice want to communicate security
  - Trudy may intercept, delete, add messages
  
  - who might Bob, Alice be?
    - Web browser/server for electrinic trasactions
    - on-line banking client/serber
    - DNS servers
    - routers exchanging routing table updates
  
<br />

3. The language of cryptography
  - symmetiric key cryptography
    - symmetric key crypto: Bob and Alice share same key
    - ex) key is knowing substitution pattern in mono alphabetic substitution chiper
    - how do Bob and Alice agree on key value?
  - Public key cryptography
    - symmetric key crypto
      - requires sender, receiver know shared secret key
    - public key crypto
      - redically different approach (Diffle-Hellman76, RSA78)
      - sender, receiver do not share secret key
      - public encryption key known to all
      - private decryption key known only to receiver
  - RSA: another important property
    - The following property, will be very useful later
    - use public key first, followed by private key
    
<br />

4. Authentication
  - Goal : avoid playback attack
  - nonce : number (R) used only once-in-a-lifetime
  - ap4.0 : to prove alice live, Bob sends Alice nonce, R. Alice muste return R, encrypted with shared secret key

<br />

5. Digital signatures
  - cryptographic technique analogous to hand-written sigatures:
    - sender digitally signs document, establishing he is document owner/creator.
    - verifiable, nonforgeable: recipient can prove to someone that Bob, and no one else, must have signed document
  - simple digital signature for message m:
    - Bob signs m by encrypting with his private key K, creating signed message K(m)
  - Message digest
    - computationally expensive to public key encrypt long messages
    - goal : fixed-length, easy-to-compute digital fingerprint
      - apply hash function H to m, get fixed size message digest H(m)
    - Hash function properties
      - many-to-1
      - produces fixed size msg digest
      - given message digest x, computationally infeasible to find m such that x = H(m)
