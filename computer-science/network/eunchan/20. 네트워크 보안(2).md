1. SSL and TCP/IP
  - SSL provides application prigramming interface to applications
  - C and Java SSL libraries/classes readily avaliabl
  
  - Toy SSL : a simple secure channel
    - handshake : Alice and Bob use their certificates, private key to authenticate each other and exchange shared secret
    - key derivation : Alice and Bob use shared secret to derive set of keys
    - data transfer : data to be transferred is broke up into series of records
    - connection closure : special messages to securely close connection

  - data records
    - why not encrypt data in constant stream as we write it to TCP?
    > where would we put the MAC? if at end, no message integrity untill all data processed.
    - instead, break stream in series of records
      - each record carries a MAC
      - receiver can act on each record as it arrives
    - issue: in record, receiver needs to distinguish MAC from data
      - want to use variable-length record

  - control information
    - problem: truncation attack
      - attacker forges TCP connection close segment
      - one or both sides thinks there is less data than there actually is.
    - solution : record types, with one type for closure
      - type 0 for data; type 1 for closure

   - SSL record protocol
     - record header : content type; version; length
     - MAC : includes sequence number, MAC key M
     - frgment : each SSL fragment 2^14 bytes

2. firewalls
  - isolates organication's internal net from larger internet, allowing some packets to pass, blocking others
  - ex) no outside web access, prevent web-radios from eating up the available bandwith..
  - ACL : table of rules, applied top to bottom to incoming packets

  - stateful packet filtering
    - statless packet filter : heavy handled tool
    - stateful packet filter : track status of every TCP conenction
      - track connection setip(SYN), teardown (FIN) : determine whether incoming, outgoing packets make sense
