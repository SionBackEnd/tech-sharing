1. Addressing : routing to another LAN
  - A creates IP datagram with IP source A, destination B
  - A creates link layer frame with R's MAC address as dest, frame contians A to B IP datagram
  - frame sent from A to B
  - frame received at R, datagrm removed, passed up to IP
  - R forwards datagram with IP source A, destination B
  - R creates link-layer frame with B's MAC address as dest, frame contains A-to-B IP datagram

2. Switch : miltiple simultaneous transmissons
  - hosts have dedicated, direct connection to switch
  - switches buffer packets
  - Ethernet proctocol used on each incoming link, but no collisions; full duplex
    - each link is its own collision domain
  - switching : A-to-A and B-toB can transmit simultaneously, without collisions
  
  (1) Siwtching forwoard table? : Self-learning
    - switch leanrs which hosts can be reaced thorugh wich interfaces.
      - when frame received, switch learns localtion of sender; incoming LAN segment
      - records sender/location pair in switch table
  
  (2) Self learning, forwarding example
    - frame destination. A'. locaation unknown
    - destination A localtion known : selectively send on just one link
  
  (3) interconnectiong switches
    - switches can be connected together

3. Switch VS routers
  - both are store-and-forward :
    - routers : network-layer devices (examine network-layer headers)
    - switches : link-layer devices (examine link-layer headers)
  - both have forwarding tables :
    - routers : compute tables using routing algorithms, IP addresses
    - switches : learn forwarding table using flooding, learning, MAC address

4. Data center networks
  - 10's to 100's of thousands of hosts, often closely coupled, in close proximity
    - e-business (Amazone..)
    - content-servers (Youtube, Akamai, Apple, MS..)
    - search engines, data mining (google..)
  - challenges
    - multiple applications, each serving massive numbers of client
    - managing/balancing load, avoiding processing, networking, data bottlenecks
