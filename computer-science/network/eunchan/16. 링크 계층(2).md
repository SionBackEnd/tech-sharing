## 1. Ethernet
  - dorminant wired LAN technology
    - cheap $20 for NIC
    - first widely used LAN technology
    - simpler, cheaper than token LANs and ATM
    - kept up with speed race: 10 Mbps ~ 10 Gbps
  
  (1) physical topology
    - bus : popular through mid 90s
      - all nodes in same collision domain
    - star: prevails today
      - active switch in center
      - each "spoke" run a (separate) Ethernet procol (nodes do not collide with each other)

  (2) Ethernet frame structure
    - sending adapter encapsulates IP datagram(or other network layer protocol packet) in Ethernet frame
    - preamble
      - 7 bytes with pattern 10101010 followed by one byte with pattern 10101011
      - used to synchronize receiver, sender clock rates
   
  (3) Ethernet : unreliable, connectionless
    - connectionless : no handshake between sending and receiving NICs
    - unreliable : receiving NIC doesnt send acks or nacks to sending NIC
      > collision만 회피하면 통신에 아무런 문제가 없기 때문에 acks가 필요 없음
      - data in dropped frames recovered only if initial sender uses higher rdt (e.g TCP), otherwise dropped data lost
    - Ethernet's MAC protocol: unslotted CSMA/CD with binary backoff
  
  (4) Ethernet uses CSMA/CD
    - No slots
    - adapter dosen't transmit if it senses that some other adapter is transmitting, taht is carrier sense
    - transmitting adapter aborts when it senses that another adapter is transmitting, that is, collision detection
    - before attepting a retransmission, adapter waits a random time, that is, random access
    
  (5) is it possible that ?
    - case : a cllision happens in Ethernet but is not detected at the MAC layer
      > Minimum byte를 준수해야 Collision이 발생했을 때 감지할 수 있음(add padding)
      
  (6) MAC addresses and ARP
    - 32-bit IP addresses:
      - network-layer address for interface
      - used for layer 3(netowrk layer) forwarding
    - MAC (LAN/physical/Ethernet) address:
      - function : used locally to get frame frome one interface to another physically-connected interface
      - 48 bit MAC address(for most LANs) burned in NIC ROM, also somtimes software settable
